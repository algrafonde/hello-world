# hello-world
#### First steps in GitHub

This repository is **useless**, since it's only reason of existance is to achieve a certain agility in version control.

For now, this have been the only branches (~~striked~~ means already merged)

| Branch | Changes | Reason |
|---|---|---|
|main|creation of README.md file|following the GitHub Guide|
|~~Readme-edits~~|writing in said file|Why not?|

I'm just adding this line to test pushing from terminal.
Test was successful, changes were commited without problems.

Current TO_DO list:

- [x] Create new branch
- [x] Merge said branch
- [ ] Get hired already
